# leeboy-equipment-scraper
## This scrapes information from the Leeboy site and turns it into beautiful soup, then packs that soup in to-go containers and sends it off to the specified database.

## Use
* Install `node.js` and `npm`
* Create a `.credentials.env` file in the main folder; this should have DB_USERNAME and DB_PASSWORD keys. These are the private database credentials.
* Edit the `.env` file to change public database credentials (such as host, database name, and table name)
* Double-click `run.command` to start. If you don't see a bowl of soup, hard refresh (Cmd+Shift+R)
* Wait for the magic to happen
